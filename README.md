## Cryptographically Compute General Matrix Multiplication

* Use HElib as the basic FHE implementation.
    * Install NTL, GMP
    * Install google test for running unit tests
* Use Boost network library
* Tremendously using two packings
    * CRT packing i.e., SMID bactching
    * Forward-backward packing
